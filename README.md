# Learning Log WebApp
A web app called Learning Log that allows users to
log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and make journal entries as
they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read
and edit existing entries.
